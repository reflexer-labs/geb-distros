-- ==== Reward calculation ====

-- Note: This script does not reward for the exact borrow balance.
-- Due to the constantly accruing borrow balance we only consider
-- the borrow balance at the time of the event thus overdistributing 
-- a bit. We distribute like if the accured part was constant since the
-- last crediting.

      ) AS delta_reward_per_token
      
  FROM with_start_events),

-- Calculated the actual reward_per_token from the culmulative delta
aave_reward_per_token AS (
  SELECT *,
    SUM(delta_reward_per_token) OVER(ORDER BY block_timestamp, log_index) AS reward_per_token
  FROM aave_deltas
),

-- 2) Credit reward for each user at each event

-- basically the earned() function from a staking contract
aave_earned AS (
  SELECT *,
    --                       ⬇ userRewardPerTokenPaid                                                                             ⬇ balance just before

  FROM aave_reward_per_token
),


-- ==== Output results ====

-- Sum up the earned event per address
final_reward_list AS (
  SELECT address, SUM(earned) AS reward
